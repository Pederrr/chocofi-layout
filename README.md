# Vial config for Chocofi keyboard

This is my personal Vial configuration for my Chocofi (36 keys). Uses Colemak-DH with home row mods.

Precompiled Vial firmware for the board [can be found here](https://docs.beekeeb.com/chocofi-keyboard#rp2040-based-boards)

## Layers:
- base layer: Colemak-DH with home row mods
- symbol layer: symbols used in programming - trying to be Python optimized and keeping vim in mind
- number layer: numbers and arithmetic symbols
- navigaton layer: primarily arrows
    - So I do not have to remap 'hjkl' for general movement in vim
    - I also use these to move focus between windows in my window manager (hyprland)
- layer for swapping workspaces in my window manager (hyprland): binds for super + 1-9
- function + media layer: F1-F12 keys, print screen, volume, media playback, screen brightness
- mouse navigation layer: mouse movement and buttons

## TODO
- Figure out if I can write slovak accented characteres without switching keyboard layout in OS
    - Would be nice to have a dedicated key for the '´' dead key
- Decide if I want to keep the mouse navigation layer, or if the layer could be used for something else
