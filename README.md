# Vial config for Chocofi keyboard

This is my personal Vial configuration for my Chocofi (36 keys). Uses Colemak-DH with home row mods.

Precompiled Vial firmware for the board [can be found here](https://docs.beekeeb.com/chocofi-keyboard#rp2040-based-boards)

## Layers:
- base layer: Colemak-DH
- symbol layer: symbols used in programming - trying to be Python optimized
- number layer: numbers and arithmetic symbols
- navigaton layer: arrows - so I do not have to remap 'hjkl' in vim
- mouse navigation layer: mouse movement and buttons (cool ideam, but not sure how much I'll use it)
- function layer: F1-F12 keys, print screen, ...
- media layer: volume, media playback, screen brightness)

## TODO
- Figure out if I can write slovak accented characteres without switching keyboard layout in OS
    - Would be nice to have a dedicated key for the '´' dead key
- Add shortcuts specific to my window manager
- Tweak the symbol/number layers further based on usage
- Decide if I want to keep the mouse navigation layer, and if the space could be used better
